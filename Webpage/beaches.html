            <h1>Discover the Beaches</h1>
            <p>A beach is a narrow, gently sloping strip of land that separates a body of water from inland areas. Beaches are made of sand, pebbles, rocks, and seashell fragments, which are the result of weathering and erosion over thousands of years. Waves and currents create beaches by depositing sediment from nearby rock cliffs along the shoreline.</p>
